# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.


## TODO

- [ ] Update README with usage documentation
- [ ] Implement training based on command-line inputs
- [x] Unit test the full implementation


## Unit Test Coverage

To run unit tests (assuming Python 3)

* `python -m unittest nn_trainer.<submodule>`
  * Example: `python -m unittest nn_trainer.utils_test`
